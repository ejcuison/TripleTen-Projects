## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps & Methodology

1. **Conversion Funnel Creation**
   - Built a pivot table using `raw_user_activity`
   - Added columns for overall and step-by-step conversion rates

2. **Purchase Filtering**
   - Filtered only "purchase" events
   - Created a `purchase_activity` sheet with relevant data

3. **First Purchase Identification**
   - Pivot table to find each user's first purchase date
   - Used `VLOOKUP()` to add `first_purchase_date` to user rows

4. **Cohort Grouping**
   - Added `event_month`, `first_purchase_month`, and `cohort_age` columns
   - Used `TEXT()` and `DATEDIF()` for time transformations

5. **Cohort Analysis**
   - Built a pivot table grouped by `first_purchase_month`
   - Counted unique users per `cohort_age`

6. **Retention Rate Calculation**
   - Created a `retention_rates` sheet
   - Used formulas to calculate month-over-month retention by cohort

7. **Executive Summary & Organization**
   - Added insights and visuals to an `Executive Summary` sheet
