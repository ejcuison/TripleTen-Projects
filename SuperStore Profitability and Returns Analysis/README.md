## Overview  
This Tableau-driven project analyzes sales and returns data from the \*Superstore.xls\* dataset to uncover key insights that drive profitability and operational efficiency. The focus includes identifying profit centers, loss-makers, inefficient products, and strategic advertising opportunities.

## Data Source  
\- File: Superstore.xls  
\- Tables: \`Orders\`, \`People\`, \`Returns\`

## Tools Used  
\- Tableau

## Methodology  
\- LEFT JOINed \`Returns\` table onto \`Orders\`  
\- Created a calculated field \`Returned\` (1 \= Yes, 0 \= Null)  
\- Developed multiple visualizations to analyze:  
  \- Profit by subcategory and region  
  \- Least and most profitable products  
  \- Profit trends by subcategory  
  \- State and month combinations for optimal advertising  
  \- Products and customers with highest return rates  
  \- Average profit vs. return rate by state

## Key Findings  
\- Top Profit Centers: Copiers (West region) and Chairs (East region)  
    
\- Top Loss Makers: Binders (Central region) and Tables (East region)

\- Products to Eliminate:  
  \- Over 10 products with negative profit  
  \- Top candidate: \*GBC DocuBind P400 Electric Binding System\*

\- Subcategories to Focus On: Copiers, Phones, Accessories

\- Subcategories to Stop Selling: Tables, Bookcases, Supplies

\- Advertising Recommendations:  
  \- Best state & month combinations:  
    \- Vermont (November) – Budget: $119.20  
    \- Indiana (October) – Budget: $128.62  
    \- Washington (March) – Budget: $104.26  
  \- Budget set at ⅕ of profits for each target

\- Returns Insights:  
  \- 8 products with 100% return rate  
  \- Customers with highest return rates: Hilary Holden & Roland Murray (100%)

\- State-Level Profitability:  
  \- Best: Vermont – Avg. Profit: $200, Return Rate: 0%  
  \- States to reconsider: Oregon, Tennessee, Colorado (low profit \+ high return rates)

## Conclusion  
The analysis reveals actionable opportunities to enhance profitability by discontinuing loss-making products and subcategories, focusing marketing efforts strategically, and addressing high return rates.
