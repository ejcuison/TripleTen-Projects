## Overview

This project analyzes NYC Airbnb data to identify the most attractive neighborhoods and property sizes for vacation rentals, and to estimate potential revenue for top listings.

## Objectives

* Determine which neighborhoods and property sizes are most attractive for vacation rentals
* Estimate revenue generated by the most attractive listings
* Apply professional spreadsheet formatting and documentation standards

## Data Source

* `nyc_airbnb_data_v2.xls`

## Tools Used

* Google Sheets / Excel

## Methodology

### 1. Identify Attractive Neighborhoods & Property Sizes

* **Data Cleaning**: Standardized neighborhood and bedroom columns (`neighborhood_clean`, `bedrooms_clean`)
* **Pivot Tables**: Analyzed number of reviews (LTM) to identify top 10 neighborhoods and most popular property sizes
* **Visualization**: Bar chart for review count of top 10 neighborhoods
* **Recommendation**: Matched popular property sizes to each top neighborhood

### 2. Estimate Revenue of Top Listings

* **Flagging Top Listings**: New column `top_listing` (1 if meets attractiveness criteria)
* **Revenue Calculation**:

  * In calendar data: nightly revenue via `revenue_earned` column
  * In listings data: total 30-day revenue imported with `SUMIF()`
  * Annualized revenue by multiplying monthly value by 12
* **Analysis**: Pivot table ranking top listings by revenue

### 3. Final Formatting & Documentation

* Hidden unnecessary columns
* Added executive summary and table of contents
* Documented cleaning steps and assumptions
* Standardized formatting (fonts, borders, colors)
